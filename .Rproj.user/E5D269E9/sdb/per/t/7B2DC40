This package also proposes a consensus method, named Spectral Consensus Strategy, that integrates multiple reconstruction algortihms embedded by scalenet to provide robust predictions.\nDepends: R (>= 2.5.0),\n         doSNOW,\n         foreach,\n         doParallel,\n         bnlearn,\n         minet,\n         fpc,\n         e1071,\n         prettyR\nLicense: What license is it under?\nLazyData: TRUE\nRoxygenNote: 5.0.1\nSuggests: testthat\nImports:\n\n",
