Title: Network reconstruction from high-dimensional data based on spectral decomposition and consensus strategy
Version: 1.2.2

Description: The scalenet approach embeds any type of network discovery approach within a spectral framework for large graphical model reconstruction. This package also proposes a consensus method, named Spectral Consensus Strategy, that integrates multiple reconstruction algortihms embedded by scalenet to provide robust predictions.
