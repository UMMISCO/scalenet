```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Installation guide

```{r}
# install the CRAN packages
install.packages(c("doSNOW", "doParallel", "bnlearn","fpc","e1071","prettyR"), dependencies = TRUE)

# There is a bioconductor package

if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("minet")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
